This final project is a combination of ray tracing from HW3 and 3D transformations from HW2.1. It is a 3D free driving game where the arrow keys are used to thrust and rotate the car. The headlight of the car is a point light that is fixed in relation to the car such that it is always in the cone. There are 8 trees made from 3 clipped quadrics each. The components of the car are 4 multi clipped quadrics. First person camera was also implemented by fixing the camera in relation to the car. There is also an infinite ground plane procedurally textured to look like wood.
