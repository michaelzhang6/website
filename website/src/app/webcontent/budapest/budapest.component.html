<h2>Study Abroad at AIT Budapest</h2>
<p> I am spending the first semester of my junior year studying abroad at AIT Budapest. AIT Budapest
    is a well known study abroad program designed specifically for computer science majors. I have always
    wanted to study abroad as well as travel around Europe, so this program was a perfect fit for what I wanted
    to study and where I wanted to go.
